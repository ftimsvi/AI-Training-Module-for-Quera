# AI Training Module for Quera

This project proposes an **AI Training Module** as an extension for the **Quera platform**. The work focuses on **software engineering design** rather than implementation, emphasizing **structural, functional, and behavioral modeling** to capture system requirements and design decisions.

Quera is a leading competitive programming platform. However, during recent AI competitions, users faced challenges with downloading large datasets from external sources and a lack of integrated computational resources. This project aims to solve these problems by adding a built-in AI training module to Quera, allowing users to upload data, train machine learning models, and evaluate them directly on the platform using managed CPU/GPU resources.
